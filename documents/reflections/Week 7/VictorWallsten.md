### What do I want to learn or understand better?
I would like to understand Android app development architecture in general; it just feels messy, but
that is probably due to ignorance.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
At this point, the best way to help someone learn is to stay attentive when pair programming and try
to make sure both understand what is being done and why.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Being present and active during meetings, trying to focus on suggesting tasks that will create the
highest value for the user before the project ends.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I collaborated with some teammates on creating a new fragment that can be shown and hidden on
demand, containing controls for the route recording functionality and displaying the time and
distance of the current route.
