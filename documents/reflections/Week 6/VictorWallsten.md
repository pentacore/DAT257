### What do I want to learn or understand better?
I'm not quite sure what I want to learn next. It will probably become apparent during the next
sprint planning meeting.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I helped a team member learn some of the basics on connections between the drawable resources and
the visible elements of the app. As an aside, Android frontend development is a mess.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
As we're nearing the end of the project's time frame, I've tried to shift the focus onto finishing a
working minimal app, necessarily forsaking some nice-to-have-but-not-essential features. I think we
will be able to deliver an app of some value in the end, as long as we focus on the right things.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I implemented a toggle for the map view that, when active, locks the view onto the user's position
and sets the orientation to the direction of the user.
