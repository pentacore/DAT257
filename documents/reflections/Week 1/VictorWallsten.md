### What do I want to learn or understand better?
Having no prior experience with programming for mobile devices, nor any experience coding in Kotlin,
those are the areas I need to research.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
From what I've been told, Kotlin tries to be a bit more functional in its nature compared to Java. I
can share my knowledge about functional programming if need be.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Just being present and active during all of our meetings. I do have some prior Scrum experience, but
there are others in the team with far more experience than I, so it's better to let them run the
show.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I helped, as we all did, with establishing the social contract.
