### What do I want to learn or understand better?
We've discussed refactoring the Android-specific code into Fragments, so I've been reading up on
that -- I understand the basic idea, but I need to discuss it further with the team before I'd feel
comfortable actually making any changes. We've also discussed restructuring according to an
MVC-esque design pattern -- I'm familiar with the concept, but I'll have to consult the team member
who's taking the lead on this change to make sure I understand what variant of the pattern we intend
to use.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I've helped a team member with familiarising themselves with the Git interface of our IDE of choice,
as well as the team's intended Git workflow. Team communication has improved drastically -- learning
from others and helping others learn has worked very well. I hope and think it will keep improving,
as long as we keep reflecting on the matter every week.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
It feels like the team has become rather efficient during the daily stand-up meetings. We've also
become better at utilising the sprint board properly -- for example, task definitions have become
clearer, which is something I've tried to contribute to. I think we are fairly close to having an
MVP, and will try to make sure we focus on achieving that goal during the upcoming sprint planning
meeting.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I found an OpenStreetMap library for Android, and implemented a working world map with
latitude/longitude and zoom parameters in cooperation with a team member.
