### What do I want to learn or understand better?
Information passing between fragments and storage of information within the app.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
When group memebers express being stuck or having questions about design decisions I'll readily
assist and try to find relevant information/tutorials if I don't have the answer readily available.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I've partaken in each of our daily stand-up's including the weekly sprint-planning.
I've suggested and given feedback to different stories and underlying tasks through which said stories may progress/be completed.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I've started with a preference tab and are trying to find ways to implement said element in a way that
keeps in line of how the project is organised. I've contributed during some smaller pair-programming sessions.
