### What do I want to learn or understand better?
As this was the final week of development, there is nothing I wish to learn next. What I have
learned, though, is to never develop an Android app again. Yuck.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
At this point, all of my team members are omniscient; I have nothing left to offer that would be of
value to them.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Being present and active during meetings. Yep.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Mostly minor polishing and bug fixing prior to the presentation to make our app slightly less
embarrassing to put on display.
