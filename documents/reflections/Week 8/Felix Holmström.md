### What do I want to learn or understand better?
To better understand how to modify layouts through code rather than strictly in XML (and the in-between-land
where some elements are dictated by code while others are in XML).

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Be readily available and answer questions that may arise related to XML since I'm mostly comfortable
in XML and some of the available tags.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I've been present during our weekly meeting and contributed by suggesting tasks that would allow us
to wrap up this project.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
In code, sadly not much since it proved a bit more difficult that I had initially anticipated to
modify the previously implemented semi-code/XML view.
