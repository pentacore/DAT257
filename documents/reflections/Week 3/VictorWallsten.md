### What do I want to learn or understand better?
I've mainly been learning about a specific toolkit we intend to use for our REST API. I've come to
grips with the basic server/client usage, but some more understanding about the intended
architecture of our application is needed for proper integration.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Collaborative learning has been lackluster so far. Other than the daily stand-up meetings, the team
isn't gathering at all in any capacity. Some half-arsed attempts have been made, but nothing has
come of it. I need to discuss this with my teammates so we can improve the situation.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Not much has been contributed other than being present at the meetings. I've been struggling with
motivation in general this past week, and need to find a way out of this rut.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
It's been decided that the first team reflection is to be done on Monday, to coincide with the
transition into next week's sprint. Hence, there hasn't been an opportunity to contribute to this
week's administrative deliverables.
