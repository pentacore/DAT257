### What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn more about osmdroid, the primary OpenStreetMap library we use, as it probably
includes some more ready-made solutions for things we wish to implement.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I helped a team member convert our timer Activity to a Fragment and integrate it into our app.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
When planning our sprint, I've argued in favour of prioritising tasks that deliver the highest value
to the end users, rather than developer-centric ones, since the project has a rather short time
frame. Soon it will be time to start focusing on just stitching together a working minimal app.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I converted our map Activity to a Fragment and implemented a navigation bar that lets us choose
what Fragment to display.
