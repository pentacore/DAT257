What is:
The current situation is a synthesis between not yet fully grasping the different aspects of the chosen coding language (Kotlin), the IDE (Android Studios) as well as android/app development overall.

What should be:
What should be is being able to create a mockup app with basic functionality relevant to usage of the map-API.

How to reduce the gap:
Diligent reading of both documentation regarding the API and seeking solutions to small and well-defined problems in regards to Kotlin, preferably in combination with pair-programming as to build a flow.
