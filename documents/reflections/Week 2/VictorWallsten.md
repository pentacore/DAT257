### What do I want to learn or understand better?
We have discussed what type of project we want to carry out and, with it, some possible APIs and
frameworks to be used. All of them are new to me, so I need to learn the basics about those things.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
It seems most of us are new to the aforementioned APIs and frameworks, so I think it would benefit
the team if, after some research, we gather and share our new-found knowledge with each other.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We've discussed some details regarding the first sprint in order to ensure a smooth start.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
We've collaborated on this week's deliverables: the project description, business dat257.gyro.model canvas, and
mockup.
