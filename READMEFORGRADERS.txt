Welcome to the Gyro gitrepository.

The code is split in such a way: Backend and app. There is also a shared section for any shared classes.
The app is split into fragments that can be called by the mainactivity piece. From there smaller services and things are selfexplanatory.
You can see some further details on this in the other README.

The self reflections can be found under documents/reflections in the repo. Most have put their reflections under the appropriate week. And outlier is Erik who has their reflections in a single document.

In terms of names you may see that could be confounding:
Pentacore = Martin Claesson
